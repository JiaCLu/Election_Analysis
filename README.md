## Project Overview
The election commission has requested election analysis with some additional data: the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. Tom, and I are team up together using Python to write algorithms to perform election results. The purpose of this election audit analysis provide total results along with the county votes, winner candidate and the percentage of winner vote.

## Election Audit Summary
	The Colorado election audit report shown total number of votes cast, total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes, and the winner of candidate base on the votes. We utilized the data set for the votes from mail-in Ballot, punch cards, and direct recording electronic to perform the election report. This election script can be modify for any election in the future by importing new data file (.csv) to load in the script, and modify variables with new dataset that want to analyze the outcomes.
